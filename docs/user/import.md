# `import`

`import` manages fixed-revision Installations and managed Refs.

See [common.md](common.md) for shared interface and errors.

Installation directories are read-only. Use [`worktree create`](worktree.md) when you need to branch, modify, or commit from an Installation's recorded commit.

## Install

```bash
doctidex-git import install \
  (--tracked | --untracked) \
  --url <GIT-URL> \
  (--branch <BRANCH> | --tag <TAG> | --commit <HASH>) \
  [--key <QUERY-KEY>]...
```

`--tracked` or `--untracked` is required. Exactly one revision selector is required.

Branch and tag selectors resolve once. Re-running the same branch/tag with an unchanged remote commit reuses the Installation; a changed commit replaces it.

For a branch or tag Installation, the reported `install-path` is a symbolic link to the shared Installation worktree for the resolved commit. Commands continue to use the reported path; the symlink does not change Installation read-only behavior.

Success:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": {},
  "install-id": "<INSTALL-ID>",
  "install-path": "/.doctidex-git/imports/<DOMAIN>/<REPOSITORY>/<SELECTOR>"
}
```

## Restore and track

```bash
doctidex-git import restore --install-id <INSTALL-ID>
doctidex-git import track --install-id <INSTALL-ID>
```

`restore` accepts only tracked Installations and uses the recorded `commit-hash`; it does not re-resolve a branch or tag. `track` promotes an untracked Installation to tracked.

## Ref management

```bash
doctidex-git import ref \
  --install-id <INSTALL-ID> \
  [--src-sub-dir <INSTALL-REPOSITORY-PATH>] \
  --target-dir <REPOSITORY-PATH>

doctidex-git import unref --target-dir <REPOSITORY-PATH>
```

`ref` creates a relative symlink and derives an `import-ref` boundary. `--target-dir` must not be inside `/.doctidex-git/imports/` or `/.doctidex-git/worktrees/`, and must not be below an existing boundary point. Creating a Ref promotes its Installation to tracked. `unref` is a no-op when no Ref exists and is blocked while a Markdown link crosses the Ref boundary.

## Query

```bash
doctidex-git import query \
  (--install-id <INSTALL-ID> | --install-path <REPOSITORY-PATH> | \
   --ref-path <REPOSITORY-PATH> | --key <QUERY-KEY>...)
```

Exactly one selector class is required. `--key` is repeatable fuzzy search.

`restore-state` is one of `available`, `restore-required`, or `missing`. A tracked Installation with only
metadata and no physical worktree is `restore-required`; run `import restore --install-id <INSTALL-ID>` to make
it available. An untracked Installation with a missing physical path is `missing`.

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": {},
  "candidates": [
    {
      "git-url": "<GIT-URL>",
      "commit-hash": "<HASH>",
      "install-id": "<INSTALL-ID>",
      "install-path": "/<INSTALL-PATH>",
      "restore-state": "available",
      "keys": ["<QUERY-KEY>"],
      "branch": "<BRANCH-OR-EMPTY>",
      "tag": "<TAG-OR-EMPTY>",
      "refs": [
        {"src-sub-dir": "/<INSTALL-SUB-DIR-OR-EMPTY>", "target-dir": "/<REPOSITORY-PATH>"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Remove

```bash
doctidex-git import remove \
  (--install-id <INSTALL-ID> | --untracked | --auto | --branch <BRANCH>...)
```

`--install-id` selects one Installation. `--untracked` selects all untracked Installations. `--auto` selects untracked Installations and Installations without managed Refs.

`--branch` is repeatable and selects branch snapshots by branch short name. The currently checked-out branch cannot be
selected; an unknown branch name is a no-op.

`--auto` additionally removes branch snapshots whose branch no longer exists locally. The current branch is never
removed by `--auto`.

Removal is blocked when a tracked Installation still has a Ref or an in-scope Markdown link crosses its boundary.

Removing an Installation removes its share membership. The shared physical worktree survives while another branch
still references the same share.

Removing a branch snapshot also removes that branch from `InstallationShare.branch-refs`. When a share has no
remaining `install-ids`, `context-references`, or `branch-refs`, the share and its physical worktree are deleted.

## Unload

```bash
doctidex-git import unload --install-id <INSTALL-ID>...
```

`--install-id` is repeatable and at least one is required. `unload` accepts only tracked Installations and detaches
them from their Installation share while keeping the Installation record. A tracked Installation that is already
`restore-required` is a no-op.

Unloading a branch or tag Installation removes its selector symlink. A direct-commit Installation's physical checkout
is removed only when its share has no remaining `install-id`, `context-reference`, or `branch-ref`; when none remain,
the share and its physical worktree are deleted.

Managed Refs and cross-boundary Markdown links are left in place. After unload, `import query` reports
`restore-required`, and `import restore --install-id <INSTALL-ID>` recreates the physical checkout.

## Handleable errors

| Code | Cause and next step |
|---|---|
| `revision.unresolvable` | Selector cannot resolve to a commit. |
| `cache.repository.unavailable` | Bare repository cannot be obtained. |
| `installation.target.unavailable` | Install path is occupied or unusable. |
| `installation.not-found` | Requested Installation does not exist. |
| `installation.tracking-state.invalid` | `restore` or `unload` received an untracked Installation. |
| `installation.restore.unavailable` | Tracked Installation cannot be restored at its commit. |
| `installation.restore.required` | A tracked Installation is not restored; run `import restore`. |
| `installation.remove.blocked` | Ref or cross-boundary link still depends on the Installation. |
| `installation.unload.reconcile.failed` | A selector symlink, share, or physical worktree could not be removed during unload. |
| `import.branch-snapshot.remove.current-branch` | `--branch` named the currently checked-out branch. |
| `import.branch-snapshot.reconcile.failed` | A share or physical worktree could not be cleaned during snapshot removal. |
| `ref.source.unavailable` | Installation or `src-sub-dir` cannot be a link source. |
| `ref.target.unavailable` | Target is occupied, is under a managed directory, is below an existing boundary point, or cannot be created. |
| `ref.target.inconsistent` | Physical symlink does not match the Ref record. |
| `ref.remove.blocked` | Markdown link still crosses the Ref boundary. |

## Installation context

To run an import command against an Installation, pass its owner-side `install-id`:

```bash
doctidex-git --repos-path <OWNER-ROOT> --installation-context <INSTALL-ID> import query ...
doctidex-git --repos-path <OWNER-ROOT> --installation-context <INSTALL-ID> import restore --install-id <INSTALL-ID>
```

In Installation context, `import query` and `import restore` are allowed. `import restore` reads the local
Installation and installs it into the owner work model as an untracked Installation. `import install`,
`import track`, `import ref`, and `import unref` are forbidden. `import remove` and `import unload` are not
available in Installation context.

Running an import command with a path inside a managed Installation but without `--installation-context`
produces `installation.context.argument-required`.

When an Installation-context `import query` result has no `presentation-path`, the Installation has not yet been restored into the owner work model. In the same Installation context, run `import restore --install-id <INSTALL-ID>` to install it and obtain its owner-side path.

In Installation-context query results, a candidate with `presentation-path` is `available`; otherwise
`restore-state` falls back to the local `install-path` check.
